## Table of Content

We should include all the slides here 

Also, we should include the students scores here so we can see how they are doing in a particular area.
 
This should also include the examples

Finally, we should also have exercises that can be evaluated on the server side and the answer should be recorded here

```javascript
require(example);
```

  include:js``` 
  /** 
   * Created by osama on 6/17/2015. 
   */ 
  //have a module here or a class where you can add examples too and it would be parse 
  var example = require('./exercise'); 
   
  var slide = "01-goals.md"; 
   
  var code = 'console.log("hello")' + 
  'Hi'; 
  /** 
   * Created by osama on 6/17/2015. 
   */ 
  //have a module here or a class where you can add examples too and it would be parse 
  //var exercise = require('example'); 
   
  //Either we require a test that has to pass or we can just have an evaluated response not sure 
  var code = "this motha fucking code is up in hereeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee"; 
  ```
