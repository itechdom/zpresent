#### JQuery and AJAX

* JQuery provides an easy way to make AJAX Calls
* AJAX essentially is a request made to an API point and awaits a response
* A response comes in the form of: JSON, AJAX or even HTML
* We will deal with JSON in this class, XML is similar.
* Once a response comes back, we should handle displaying the data ourselves.

Note: Draw a diagram to show how the Request response cycle works
